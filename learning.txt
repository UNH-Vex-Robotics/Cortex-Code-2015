Things to know:
    Types
        Builtin types:
            int
            char
            float / double
        Arrays
        Signed / Unsigned
        Structs
    Read controller input
        Joystick
        Button
    Setting output
        Motors
        Relays / pneumatics
    Reading input
        Analog
        Digital
    Functions
        I will save you time to remember a few of these. Some time functions are useful for example.
        At the least, know where to find information about functions
    Code formatting / style rules
        Comments
            Comment anything non-trivial
            Comment anything you find useful or want to remmeber
            One line comments
                // go like this
            Multiline comments
                /* start like this
                and end like so */
        INDENTATION
            Indent your code properly
            This is important. Very important. You WILL get called out if you don't indent your code consistently.
            I dont care if you do 2, 3, or 4 spaces per indentation level, or even if you use tabs. But do so consistently.
            Be consistent.

Example of user defined type / struct

You have a couple sets of motors on the robot. Each set of motors has a pair of shaft encoders. Say, you want a better way to keep track of this dependent system.

struct ControlledMotor {
    int motorspeed;
    int encoderspeed;
    float rpm;
};

Then, it becomes a simple matter to reference these sets.

ControlledMotor leftDriveMotor;
ControlledMotor rightDriveMotor;

float speed = (rightDriveMotor.encoderspeed + rightDriveMotor.encoderspeed) / 2.0);

leftDriveMotor.motorspeed = 100;
