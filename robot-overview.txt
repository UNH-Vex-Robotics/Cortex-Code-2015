drive            2 integrated encoders    6 drive     tank drive                       none
intake           none                     2 motors    bi-directional manual control    we need to find a good speed to run this at (and then not change it)
pusher           2 encoders               2 motors    automated push-out, return       calabration also needed, encoders for keeping the things parallel
movement         3 line sensors           none        a line-following 'mode'          this is probably mainly for autonomous
latch            2 limit sensors          ???         none?                            this is aimed at a mechanical solution, but feedback is good. the small bot may also assist in lifting itself
ball detector    N limit switches         none        none                             this is primarily for feedback in autonomous

shooter      6 integrated encoders    6 motors    ramp up, ramp down, fire, etc.    lots of different states involved here
lifter       2 limit sensors          ???         meet criteria, go!                this needs to be able to reverse its-self, and then redo everything again.
